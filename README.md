## Description

This application sets up an e-commerce database and api server for it, using sequelize and express. I wanted to build something that could help keep track of online store inventory by using API calls. I learned a lot abut using express, sequelize, MySQL, and Insomnia while working on this project.

## Installation

Download the repo, create and fill a .env file based on the sample provided, and run "npm install".

## Usage

Run the contents of the schema either in MySQL Shell or Workbench, run "npm run seed" in the terminal opened to the root folder, and then run "node server" in the same CLI.
